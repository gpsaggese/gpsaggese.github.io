# Goals

- Create small PRs
  - Allow agents to work in parallel with minimal overlap
  - Make it easy for humans to review the code and merge
- Automate the workflow
  - Specs -> Branch -> Work -> PR -> Checks -> Review -> Merge

# Tools

## Script Location

- All GitHub workflow automation tools are provided via:
  - **Invoke tasks**:
    - Defined in `helpers_root/helpers/lib_tasks/lib_tasks_git.py` and
      `helpers_root/helpers/lib_tasks/lib_tasks_gh.py`
    - Run via `invoke <task_name>` from the repository root
  - **Script files**:
    - Defined in `helpers_root/dev_scripts_helpers/git`
  - **Agent skills**:
    - Defined in `.claude/skills/github.*/SKILL.md`
    - Run via `/<skill_name>` from Claude Code
- Invoke, scripts, and skills related to Git start with `git_`, while ones related to
  GitHub start with `gh_`

## Git Branch Management

### Create and Initialize Branches

#### `git_create_issue_and_branch.py`

- Creates a GitHub issue and corresponding git branch/worktree in one operation
- Create issue and its initial branch

  ```bash
  > git_create_issue_and_branch.py --title "Fix bug in parser"
  ```

- Create with body, labels, and assignees

  ```bash
  > git_create_issue_and_branch.py \
    --title "Feature" \
    --body "Details" \
    --labels "enhancement" \
    --assignees "user1"
  ```

- Create stacked branches (e.g., `_1`, `_2`) for splitting one issue across multiple
  PRs

  ```bash
  > git_create_issue_and_branch.py --title "Large feature" --suffix 1
  ```

#### `git_branch_create`

- Create and push upstream branch, optionally creating a draft PR
- Create branch from GitHub issue

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_create --issue-id 123
  ```

- Create branch with explicit name

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_create --branch-name "MyTask456_Feature_description"
  ```

- Create branch without auto-creating draft PR

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_create --branch-name "MyTask456_Feature" --no-create-pr
  ```

### Copy and Rename Branches

#### `git_branch_copy`

- Create a new branch with the same content as the current branch (squash merge)
- Copy current branch to new auto-generated name

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_copy
  ```

- Copy with explicit new name

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_copy --new-branch-name "MyTask456_Feature_v2"
  ```

- Copy without merging master first

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_copy --skip-git-merge-master
  ```

#### `git_branch_rename`

- Rename current branch locally and remotely. If a PR exists, recreates it under the
  new name
- Rename current branch

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_rename --new-branch-name "MyTask456_Better_description"
  ```

### Query Branch Status

#### `git_branch_next_name`

- Generate a unique branch name derived from current branch to avoid conflicts
- Show next available name

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_next_name
  ```

- Generate name from specific branch

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_next_name --branch-name "MyTask456_Feature"
  ```

- Use GitHub API method (faster)

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_next_name --method github_api
  ```

#### `git_branch_is_merged`

- Check if current branch was merged into master using GitHub API and git
- Check merge status

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_is_merged
  ```

### Clean Up Branches

#### `git_branch_delete_merged`

- Remove (both local and remote) branches that have been merged into master
- Delete merged branches with user confirmation

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_delete_merged
  ```

- Delete without confirmation

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_delete_merged --no-confirm-delete
  ```

### Review Changes

#### `git_branch_diff`

- Diff files of current branch against a specified point (base, master, HEAD, or
  hash)
- Diff against branch point

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target base
  ```

- Diff against origin/master

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target master
  ```

- Diff uncommitted changes

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target head
  ```

- Diff against specific hash

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target hash --hash-value abc123def
  ```

- Diff last commit

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target last_commit
  ```

- Only Python files

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target base --file-types py
  ```

- Skip documentation files

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target base --skip-file-types txt,md
  ```

- Show files without opening vimdiff

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_diff --target base --only-print-files
  ```

#### `git_branch_files`

- Report detailed status of files changed in current branch (added, modified,
  deleted)
- Show file changes with status

  ```bash
  > invoke git_branch_files
  ```

## GitHub Workflow Management

### Authentication

#### `gh_login`

- Login to GitHub with configured SSH key and authentication token
- Login with default account

  ```bash
  > invoke gh_login
  ```

- Issue with details

  ```bash
  > invoke gh_issue_create \
    --title "Add new feature" \
    --body "Description here" \
    --labels "enhancement,priority-high" \
    --assignees "user1,user2"
  ```

- Create issue and first branch (with suffix for stacking)

  ```bash
  > invoke gh_issue_create --title "Large feature" --suffix 1
  ```

#### `gh_issue_title`

  ```bash
  > invoke gh_workflow_list --daemon
  ```

# Workflows

### How to Split Large PRs

- When a single PR becomes too large or covers multiple independent features, split
  it into stacked PRs for easier review and faster merging
- This workflow uses Claude Code skills to automate the process as in the following

1. **Start with your large branch** containing multiple independent changes
2. **Run the split skill** to analyze and plan PR divisions:
   ```bash
   /github.split_branch_in_PRs
   ```
   - This generates a `github_pr_plan.md` file with:
     - Proposed PR divisions (files grouped by feature/concern)
     - Stack order (dependencies and merge order)
     - Description for each PR
3. **Review and edit the plan** in `github_pr_plan.md`:
   - Adjust which files go into each PR
   - Reorder PRs if needed
   - Update titles and descriptions
   - Mark dependencies if PR2 depends on PR1, etc
4. **Create child PRs** for each planned branch:

   ```bash
   /github.create_child_pr PR2
   /github.create_child_pr PR3
   ```

   For each PR number in the plan, this:
   - Creates a new branch with selected files
   - Opens a draft PR with the planned description
   - Maintains dependency links via PR body references
5. **Review and merge sequentially**:
   - Merge PR1 first (base PR, usually depends on nothing)
   - Then merge PR2, PR3, etc. in order
   - Later PRs automatically include commits from earlier ones
